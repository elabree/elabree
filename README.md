## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Im am interested in pinball technology. Both real and virtual machines.
I like to play a bit, and do small repairs (only for my own machine).
Also built a virtual cabinet wit VPX, Pinscape controller and Pin2DMD / ZeDMD.

I am mostly interested in learning how to do stuff. Usually I have more idea's than actual results.
